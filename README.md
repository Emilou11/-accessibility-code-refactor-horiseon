# accessibility-code-refactor-horiseon

## Decsription

This is a refactor of the Horiseon website with a view to making it more accessible and optimise for SEO.
Firstly, I renamed the website to help with SEO. 
I was able to consolidate alot of the CSS to make it less repetitive, cleaner and easier to read. This will help with site speed and future development of the site.
I have added alt text for all the images to make those accessible for any users needing the screen reader. This helps with understanding the nature of this company website.
I have become more comfortable with the organisational elements of HTML throughtout this project.
